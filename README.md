This is the project home for the open VT Radio app.

This file will be used to list issues and to-do items:

-- Image paths for Heroku are not currently working.
-- JS needs to be changed to accomodate empty proximity response.
-- More user prompts for location services should be added.

We are attempting to host this app on heroku, and possibly move it to production  with it's own domain sometime int he future!

Thanks for reading!
