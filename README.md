<h1>This is the project home for the open VT Radio app.</h1>

<h2>This file will be used to list issues and to-do items:</h2>

<ul>
	<li>-- JS needs to be changed to accomodate empty proximity response.</li>
	<li>-- More user prompts for location services should be added.</li>
	<li>-- Text needs to be shortened / rewritten.</li>
	<li>-- Clean-up of data.</li>
</ul>

We are attempting to host this app on heroku, and possibly move it to production with it's own domain sometime in the future!

Thanks for reading!
